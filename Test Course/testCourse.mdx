# Test Course

Welcome to the first not-really-a-course-course on dot big bang learn! We should consider some standardized data here, maybe to go in the YML about levels and prereqs and target audience. I kinda like Q&A formats, but it's sort of a wordy way to get the info across. 

## Lessons

1. [Lesson 1](lesson1.mdx)
2. [Lessn 2](lesson2.mdx)
